We are going to use JPA with Hibernate for object-relational mapping, sending email with SMTP by Google, storing images with S3 storage by Amazon, authentication and authorization with JWT tokens, and cloud deployment using the Heroku platform. We will also learn data validation, exception handling, proper use of the HTTP protocol in the REST standard, security, CORS, and much more.

We will also cover the entire process of building for Android and publishing the app on the Play Store.
